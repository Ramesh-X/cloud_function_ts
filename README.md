# Typescript Cloud Functions - Firebase

This repository is an example project that do a simple cloud function trigger
which was written to explain a proper way to write cloud functions.


The architecture that is used in this small project is discussed in 
[this blog](https://www.fcodelabs.com/2020/05/04/Cloud-Functions-TS-Basic/)
and feel free to read it.

It explains a simple coding architecture that you can follow in order to make
your code more readable and manageable. Cloud functions are write in `typescript`.
But `javascript` users can also look into this article and the code to learn 
about the architecture. After all this article is about the architecture,
not the language.

Hope you find something valuable in here !!
